EDUCATION
Techstars - Startup Weekend Health - Florianópolis and Joinville (Oct and Nov 2023): it's an immersive and dynamic experience of a hands-on 54-hour journey into the realm of health innovation, exploring ideas, crafting solutions and connecting with top mentors, entrepreneurs and investors with wide market experience.
Causal Inference and Personalization (Mar 2023): it's a hands-on five-projects course that explores a variety of causal inference techniques, one technique per project, to help optimize the discounting strategy of an e-commerce business. Finally, there was an online test and an interview with the project mentor to get the certification.
Howedu Product Management Bootcamp (Nov 2022): I attended this Product Management Bootcamp to increase my business understanding and improve my translation of data science results into business results.
Howedu Data Engineering Bootcamp (May 2022 - Jul 2022): it teaches, in a practical way, all the fundamentals of data engineering so as to build robust and scalable solutions.
Le Wagon Data Science Bootcamp (Jan 2022 - Mar 2022): it teaches all the skills needed for a Data Scientist to solve real-world problems in 9 intensive weeks.
Comunidade DS (Aug 2021 - Dec 2021): it is a community focused on teaching data science by doing data science projects to solve real companies' problems.
Brazilian Naval Academy (Jan 2012 - Dec 2015): bachelor's degree in Naval Sciences. The Brazilian Naval Academy is the oldest higher education degree institution in Brazil.

Problem Solving Checkpoints
Health Insurance Cross-Sell
September 2021

Insurance All is a health insurance company and its products team is analyzing the possibility of offering a new product, automobile insurance, for its health insurance clients.
Similar to its health insurance, customers of this new insurance plan would have to pay an annual plan to be insured by Insurance All in case of an eventual car accident or damage.

In this project, I developed a Machine Learning algorithm that increases the number of contacted interested customers by 1,316 and 2,259 for 20,000 and 40,000 sales teams contacts so that the estimated revenue increases are respectively U$ 131,600 and U$ 225,900.

Tools:
SQL, Postgres.
Python.
Git, Github, Gitlab and Linux.
Rank-to-learn machine learning algorithms.
Flask API.
Heroku and Google Sheets.
